Color Management: kick test for the output color space processing using the Output Transform 

This test validates kick with output transform. I've also added some not color managed textures 
to stress a little bit more the synColor plugin (i.e. output & input color transformations).

Also I've artificially increase the number of threads to stress the multi-thread mechanism used 
by the synColor plugin cache.
