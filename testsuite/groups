# groups
#
#  This file maps all testgroups (elements on the left hand side) with their respective tests. You can also
# have a local file (groups.local) with the same format, where you can override any group in this file.
#
#  Notes:
#    - Tests can be listed in as many groups as needed.
#    - Groups can be recursively added to other groups.
#    - Special 'ignore' group lists tests that will never be executed (you can use it to temporarily disable
#      some tests or groups)
#    - There is a special group per supported OS, where you can add tests that will ONLY be executed for that
#      specific OS (linux, darwin, windows).
