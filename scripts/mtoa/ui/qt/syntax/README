syntax JSON format file

Two sections "syntax" is the main keywords, with a key for each sytax color that you want to use and "comments" is a section dedicated to highlighting single and double line comments

== Syntax section ==

Each keyword section can have three subsections

    * "paterns" - a list of regEx patterns to match to
    * "color" - a list of three byte size values (0-255) to set the highlight color for the text that matches the above pattern
    * "weight" - (optional) an enum of the weight of the text, currently only accepts "bold" as a setting
    * "italic" - (optional) a boolen value if set to true will set the text to italic


                "firstkeyword":{"patterns":["\\bmytext\\b"],
                             "color": [0, 255, 255],
                             "weight": "bold",
                             "italic": true},
                "secondkeyword":{"patterns":["\\bmyothertext\\b""],
                             "color": [255, 0, 255],
                             "weight": "bold",
                             "italic": true},

== Comments Section ==
    There are two types of comment, "single-line" and "multi-line".
    the signle -line comment has the same options as a normal syntax keyword as above.

    The multi-line commant has two pattern paramaters:

    * "start_pattern" - a regex pattern for matching the characters for the start of a multi-line comment
    * "end_pattern" - a regex pattern for matching the characters for the end of a multi-line comment

    the rest of the options (color, weight, italic) can be sued as above

    "comments": {
                 "single-line":{"patterns": ["//[^\n]*"],
                                "color": [128, 0, 0]},
                 "multi-line":{"start_pattern": "/\\*",
                               "end_pattern": "\\*/",
                               "color": [128, 0, 0]}
                }
