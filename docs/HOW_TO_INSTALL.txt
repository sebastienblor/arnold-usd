Before you can use Arnold in Maya you will need to install the MtoA plug-in and
tell Maya to use it.

 
Note that there is one plug-in for each version supported version of Maya, per
supported operating system:

 
 - Maya 2011, Windows 64 bit
 - Maya 2011, Linux 64 bit
 - Maya 2012, Windows 64 bit
 - Maya 2012, Linux 64 bit

 
 == Installation under Windows == 
 
 Download the correct MtoA pack (note that it is distributed as a compressed 
 archive, there is no installer to run), unpack it, and place it somewhere
 convenient on your machine. The following instructions assume that you are
 using Windows and have unpacked the archive to the following location:
 
 C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy
 
	 Note : if you are using 2 different version of Maya (ie 2011 and 2012) and need
	 to keep 2 different installations of MtoA, you can use:
	 
	 C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\2011
	 
	 In that case replace C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy by C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\2011 in
	 the instructions below.
 
 Next, complete the following steps:

 1. First, locate the mtoa.mod file from the download pack:
 
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\mtoa.mod
   
    Open this file in a text editor and make sure the single line contains the
    correct path, like so:
 
    + mtoa any C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy
    
	Note : it should be MtoA version number in place of "any", but Maya modules seem to choke
	on 2 digit versions, so the module path is not correctly set for MtoA versions 0.10.0 and above.
	Using 'any' will work just as well as 0.9.0.
 
 2. Next, create an environment variable MAYA_MODULE_PATH and set it to point
    to your C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy folder (the folder where mtoa.mod is
    located).
 
 3. Then, create another environment variable MAYA_RENDER_DESC and set that to
    point at the location of the arnoldRenderer.xml file (in this example,
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy).
    
 4. Create a third environment variable ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH and set it to point
    to the shaders folder, for example:
    
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\shaders    

 5. Create an environment variable MTOA_EXTENSIONS_PATH and set it to point to
	the extensions folder:
	
	C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\extensions
    
 6. Finally, you also need to add the location of the Arnold binaries to your
    path. Edit the PATH environment variable and append the bin folder path,
    for example:
    
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\bin
    
 7. Now, run Maya. Go to Window > Settings/Preferences > 
    Plug-in Manager. If you don't yet see the MtoA plug-in listed, click on the
    Browse button and locate the mtoa.mll file (under
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\plugins).

 Now you should be able to choose the Arnold renderer. There several ways to do
 this:
 
 . Click Render > Render Using, then choose the Arnold renderer.
 . Select Arnold from the drop-down list in Render View (Window > 
   Rendering Editors > Render View).
 . Select Arnold from the drop-down list in the Render Settings window.

 
 == Installation under Linux == 

 To install under Linux you will need to follow the same steps following Linux
 conventions.
