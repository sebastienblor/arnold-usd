
You need to complete a few manual steps in order to be able to use MtoA plugin:

 - Copy the 'arnoldRenderer.xml" file in this directory to the "bin/rendererDesc"
   directory inside your Maya installation root directory.
   
 - Edit the 'mtoa.mod' file in this directory, and replace the path with the
   directory where you installed MtoA.

 - Create an environment variable called MAYA_MODULE_PATH, and set it to the
   path where the "mtoa.mod" file is located.

New you should be able to open Maya and render with MtoA.
