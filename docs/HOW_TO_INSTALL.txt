
You need to complete a few manual steps in order to be able to use MtoA plugin:

 - Create an environment variable called MAYA_RENDER_DESC_PATH, and set it to
   the path where 'arnoldRenderer.xml" file is located.
   
 - Edit the 'mtoa.mod' file in this directory, and replace the path with the
   directory where you installed MtoA.

 - Create an environment variable called MAYA_MODULE_PATH, and set it to the
   path where the "mtoa.mod" file is located.
   
 - On Windows: Add MTOAINSTALLDIR\bin to the PATH environment variable.
 
   On Linux: Add MTOAINSTALLDIR/bin to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

Now you should be able to open Maya and render with MtoA.
