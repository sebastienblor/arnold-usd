Before you can use Arnold in Maya you will need to install the MtoA plug-in and
tell Maya to use it.

 
Note that there is one plug-in for each version supported version of Maya, per
supported operating system:

 
 - Maya 2011, Windows 64 bit
 - Maya 2011, Linux 64 bit
 - Maya 2012, Windows 64 bit
 - Maya 2012, Linux 64 bit

 
 == Installation under Windows == 
 
 Download the correct MtoA pack (note that it is distributed as a compressed 
 archive, there is no installer to run), unpack it, and place it somewhere
 convenient on your machine. The following instructions assume that you are
 using Windows and have unpacked the archive to the following location:
 
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy
 
 Note : if you are using 2 different version of Maya (ie 2011 and 2012) and need
 to keep 2 different installations of MtoA, you can use:
 
 C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\2011
 
 In that case replace C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy by C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\2011 in
 the instructions below.


 First, locate the mtoa.mod file from the download pack:
 
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\mtoa.mod
   
    Open this file in a text editor and make sure the single line contains the correct path, like so:
 
    + mtoa any C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy
    
    Note : it should be MtoA version number in place of "any", but Maya modules seem to choke
    on 2 digit versions, so the module path is not correctly set for MtoA versions 0.10.0 and above.
    Using 'any' will work just as well as 0.9.0.

 

 There are two ways in which to point Maya to the Arnold plugin. One waya involves adding the 
 following text to Maya's .env file (typically found in C:\Users\"USER NAME"\Documents\maya\2012-x64):

 ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH = C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\2012\shaders
 MAYA_MODULE_PATH = C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\2012
 MAYA_RENDER_DESC_PATH = C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\2012
 PATH = %PATH%;C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\2012\bin


 Using the Maya.env file is recommended so that you don’t clutter the standard environment 
 settings with Maya-specific variables. Maya.env can be set up as a roaming profile to be 
 shared by many machines. This can be useful, for example, when you are performing distributed 
 rendering among several Windows machines. Search for "Setting environment variables using 
 Maya.env" in the Maya documentation for more information on where the .env file is located 
 and how to fill it.



 The alternative method of pointing Maya to the Arnold plugin is a little bit more complicated 
 and involves adding user environment variables:

 
 1. Create an environment variable MAYA_MODULE_PATH and set it to point
    to your C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy folder (the folder where mtoa.mod is located).
 
 2. Then, create another environment variable MAYA_RENDER_DESC_PATH and set that to
    point at the location of the arnoldRenderer.xml file (in this example,
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy).
    
 3. Create a third environment variable ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH and set it to point
    to the shaders folder, for example:
    
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\shaders    

 4. Create an environment variable MTOA_EXTENSIONS_PATH and set it to point to
    the extensions folder:

    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\extensions
    
 5. Finally, you also need to add the location of the Arnold binaries to your
    path. Edit the PATH environment variable and append the bin folder path,
    for example:
    
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\bin
    
 6. Now, run Maya. Go to Window > Settings/Preferences > 
    Plug-in Manager. If you don't yet see the MtoA plug-in listed, click on the
    Browse button and locate the mtoa.mll file (under
    C:\solidangle\mtoadeploy\plugins).


 Now you should be able to choose the Arnold renderer. There several ways to do
 this:
 
 . Click Render > Render Using, then choose the Arnold renderer.
 . Select Arnold from the drop-down list in Render View (Window > 
   Rendering Editors > Render View).
 . Select Arnold from the drop-down list in the Render Settings window.

 To install under Linux you will need to follow the same steps following Linux
 conventions.
