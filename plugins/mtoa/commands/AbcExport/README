The arnoldExportAlembic plugin is used to write an Alembic file.
It contains a single command named arnoldExportAlembic.  It isn't a file
translator so it can write out multiple files with different settings while only
stepping through the frame range once.

To write out the entire scene from frame 1 to 100:
arnoldExportAlembic -j "-fr 1 100 -file scene.abc";

To write out only your selected shapes (and it's ancestor nodes):
arnoldExportAlembic -j "-sl -file scene.abc";

Other options can be viewed via:
arnoldExportAlembic -h;
